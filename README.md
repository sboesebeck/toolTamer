# ToolTamer

**ToolTamer** is a Bash script designed to automate the installation, synchronization, and cleanup of tools and configuration files across multiple systems. It leverages existing package managers like **apt** on Linux and **Homebrew** on macOS to manage software packages, ensuring a consistent and clean working environment on all your devices.

## Features

- **Automated Package Management**: Installs missing tools and removes those not listed in your configuration, preventing system clutter.
- **Configuration Synchronization**: Manages dotfiles and configuration files, synchronizing them across systems based on checksum comparisons.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both Linux and macOS systems.
- **Modular Configurations**: Uses a central configuration repository that can be shared and updated across systems.
- **Easy Setup**: If no configuration is present, ToolTamer prompts for a Git repository to check out the configuration.

2. you will be asked for a git url - if you don't want to provide any, just hit enter. You will then be asked to create a default structure in `$HOME/.config/toolTamer`. If you provided an url, it will be checked out in `$HOME/.config/toolTamer`
3. then a menu will appear (if `fzf` is available, this is being used. `select` otherwise). Here you can choose either to apply the config to your system, or take a snapshot from the system and put it in your config
